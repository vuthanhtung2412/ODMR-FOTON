"""
This file shows how to run the Pulse Streamer 8/2 without making use of the high-level Python-wrappers.
You will communicate with and access the device by directly making use of the JSON-RPC library.
For advanced application and convenient use, we recommend to have a look at the files
<2_SimplePulses.py> and <3_Tutorial.py> as well as the full documentation of the Pulse Streamer 8/2
https://www.swabianinstruments.com/static/documentation/PulseStreamer/index.html

Before you can run this example, you need to install "pulsestreamer" client package

  > pip install pulsestreamer
