This file shows how to use the Pulse Streamer 8/2.
The PulseStreamer 8/2 describes sequences made up of sequence steps. The sequence step is 
the smallest element of a sequence that contains information on the state of every output 
of the Pulse Streamer and the duration to hold this state. It is represented by a tuple 
in the form (time, [1,3], 0.8, -0.4), where time is an integer in ns (clock ticks), 
[1,3] is a list numbering the channels which should be high the last two numbers specify 
the analog outputs in volt.
To create sophisticated sequences, you can make use of the classes Sequence and OutputState. 
Class Sequence enables you to independently set pulse patterns on each of the eight digital 
and the two analog channels. A pulse pattern is represented by a tuple in the form (duration, level).
The duration is always specified in nanoseconds and the level is either 0 or 1 for digital output 
a real number between -1 and +1 in Volt for analog outputs.

You can either communicate with the hardware via JSON-RPC (recommended) or Google-RPC. As an example, how
to detetct your Pulse Streamer in the network and discover its IP-address, we recommend to have a look at
the file <1_TestConnection.py> as well as the full documentation of the Pulse Streamer 8/2
https://www.swabianinstruments.com/static/documentation/PulseStreamer/index.html

Before you can run this example, you need to install "pulsestreamer" client package

  > pip install pulsestreamer
