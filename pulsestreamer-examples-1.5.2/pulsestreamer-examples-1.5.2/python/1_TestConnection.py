"""
This script uses the device detection to test connctions to devices in the network
and connects connects to the first discovered Pulse Streamer 8/2. 
During connection and with some rpc called afterwards it prints the following hardware/software information about the Pulse Streamer:
 - Firmware version (printed by default when connection isestablished)
 - Version of the client software (printed by default when connection isestablished)
 - MAC address of the ethernet interface 
 - Serial number of the Pulse Streamer

Before you can run this example, you need to install "pulsestreamer" client package

  > pip install pulsestreamer
